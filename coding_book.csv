Dawn Nafus,This is an intro to an edited volume so no outcomes as such are advanced. However the case for looking at personal interactions with datafication through biosensing is argued., The only methodology advanced by the editor is to incorporate the responses of practitioners in the field - such as Gary Wolf and a QS entrepreneur - to offer an 'engineers eye view' ; to present views from the 'center' (by which she means people in the midst of building the domain under analysis) alongside views from social sciences where social science views are portrayed as marginal and ; to provide accounts from those engaged with the materiality / material realities of what biosensors can do, Nafus helms the Intel 'Biosensors In Everyday Life program', author appears rooted in the social sciences but wants to aspire to a mode of critique inspired by Latour - several other asides within the text indicate her to be Latourian, implicit intent hard to gauge given nature of introductory overview text, the only thing that jumped out as jarring was the lifeworld/machineworld invocation - would appear to indicate phenomenology and as such jarred with the social science tone of the rest of the intro, this intro is quite a valuable overview of the QS field and the contributors also nicely map to the institutions producing knowledge in the field
Deborah Lupton,Author intends to make a case for how sociology has something to offer self-tracking research. Prhaps coloured by the fact that its being presented at a computing conference but the sociology-contribution isn't really elaborated on. Data Doubles and institutional agency are advanced as areas for further research, Discourse Analysis, though not an affiliation Lupton is often mentioned in the QS 'What Are We Reading' newsletter so that is perhaps significant, that a Foucauldian analysis has a lot to say RE self-tracking and its diffusion to other aspects of society and that diagnosing intersecting discourses is the method useful for doing so, use of assembalge and networks intimates that maybe ANT & Latour is present in the authors intellectual traditions, I didn't connect to the assertions the author made regarding other societal sites where self-tracking is being taken up, v useful article for assessing and analysing the domain of qs (rather than data society) and then considering how that site is perhaps instantiated in other areas. Also the article should give a useful indication of Luptons forthcoming book
