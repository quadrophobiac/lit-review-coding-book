Dawn Nafus,This is an intro to an edited volume so no outcomes as such are advanced. However the case for looking at personal interactions with datafication through biosensing is argued., The only methodology advanced by the editor is to incorporate the responses of practitioners in the field - such as Gary Wolf and a QS entrepreneur - to offer an 'engineers eye view' ; to present views from the 'center' (by which she means people in the midst of building the domain under analysis) alongside views from social sciences where social science views are portrayed as marginal and ; to provide accounts from those engaged with the materiality / material realities of what biosensors can do, Nafus helms the Intel 'Biosensors In Everyday Life program', author appears rooted in the social sciences but wants to aspire to a mode of critique inspired by Latour - several other asides within the text indicate her to be Latourian, implicit intent hard to gauge given nature of introductory overview text, the only thing that jumped out as jarring was the lifeworld/machineworld invocation - would appear to indicate phenomenology and as such jarred with the social science tone of the rest of the intro, this intro is quite a valuable overview of the QS field and the contributors also nicely map to the institutions producing knowledge in the field
