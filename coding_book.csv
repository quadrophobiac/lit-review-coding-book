Dawn Nafus,This is an intro to an edited volume so no outcomes as such are advanced. However the case for looking at personal interactions with datafication through biosensing is argued., The only methodology advanced by the editor is to incorporate the responses of practitioners in the field - such as Gary Wolf and a QS entrepreneur - to offer an 'engineers eye view' ; to present views from the 'center' (by which she means people in the midst of building the domain under analysis) alongside views from social sciences where social science views are portrayed as marginal and ; to provide accounts from those engaged with the materiality / material realities of what biosensors can do, Nafus helms the Intel 'Biosensors In Everyday Life program', author appears rooted in the social sciences but wants to aspire to a mode of critique inspired by Latour - several other asides within the text indicate her to be Latourian, implicit intent hard to gauge given nature of introductory overview text, the only thing that jumped out as jarring was the lifeworld/machineworld invocation - would appear to indicate phenomenology and as such jarred with the social science tone of the rest of the intro, this intro is quite a valuable overview of the QS field and the contributors also nicely map to the institutions producing knowledge in the field
Deborah Lupton,Author intends to make a case for how sociology has something to offer self-tracking research. Prhaps coloured by the fact that its being presented at a computing conference but the sociology-contribution isn't really elaborated on. Data Doubles and institutional agency are advanced as areas for further research, Discourse Analysis, though not an affiliation Lupton is often mentioned in the QS 'What Are We Reading' newsletter so that is perhaps significant, that a Foucauldian analysis has a lot to say RE self-tracking and its diffusion to other aspects of society and that diagnosing intersecting discourses is the method useful for doing so, use of assembalge and networks intimates that maybe ANT & Latour is present in the authors intellectual traditions, I didn't connect to the assertions the author made regarding other societal sites where self-tracking is being taken up, v useful article for assessing and analysing the domain of qs (rather than data society) and then considering how that site is perhaps instantiated in other areas. Also the article should give a useful indication of Luptons forthcoming book
Deborah Lupton,Main purpose of the article is to make the case for Luptons 5 point typology regarding self-tracking as a practice diffusing into other areas,...methods...,University Cranberra,it genuinely seems like Lupton is charting a path between Latour and Foucault here - the Foucauldian approach is mentioned but more time is spent dwelling on Kitchins definition of data assemblages and the way that assemblages are languaged indicates that it is quite latourian - nowhere is Latour directly cited and there is a lot of reference to biopolitics and scholars like Rose so perhaps there is a way of considering assemblages within a totally Foucauldian outlook, ...implicit..., the use of personhood is the only head-scratcher in here, this is a very well researched article invoking relevant cross disciplinary citations and making a strong case for how typologies of tracking as well as trackers (first order and second order reflexive self-monitoring subjects) helps understand the mediation / translation between the characteristics of datafication and the practices of self trackers. This is a very NB contribution to the linkages of scales that constitutes my KRQ
James N. Gilmore,The author doesn't advance outcomes in so far as analyse a set of cases and makes suggestions for 'what this all means'. As such the points emphasised by the end of article are about necessity of methodological pluralism in order to understand the forces at work in the site that interests the author which appears to be what self-tracking technologies and habits derived from them say about our ways of knowing ourselves, phenomenological analysis ; discourse analysis ; autobiographical experience for informing the discourse analaysis, **, Author identifies with dialectics; critical hermeunetics ; draws on and develops Greenfields 'everyware'; invokes biopolitics but most references to disciplines are invoked in order to signal that the authors wants to synthesise them to describe something novel, nomenclature such as "user" and invocations of marketing psychology are invoked in non critical fashion begging the question of where the author is coming from with their hypercritical synthesis of many social theory methods but an uncritical deferrence to other authors from different disciplines assertions. Design is signalled as a discipline drawn upon but it is the least critically applied which is jarring given that a discourse analysis is presumed [CONTINUE], I am definitely alerted that it seems that this author is onto the same path as much of what I was after but the uncritical mixing of social theory and design criticism sits uncomfortably with me; the Kittler stuff feels tacked on but may be indicative of a scholar formulating a larger thesis - ergo more alarm bells. The author is definitely writing a thesis on the subject, this is an interesting article for use in phil-soci-sci and also potentially one to point to in lit review in terms of other authors synthesising a pluralistic method to describe the same domain that I am analysisng. On second reading the amount of methodological prevarication grates on me - it was interesting first time round as an instructive outline but on a second time it feels like over rumination. That said the arguments made for a methodoligcal mixture admixing or pluralism seem well considered; a  lot of the papers conclusions work well as a methodogical analysis. A lot of the authors support for socialisation seems based on the say so of technology commentators or designers in the field - ergo bias
